# Machine Learning From Scratch

This repository contains educational notebooks that demonstrate the implementation of major machine learning models from scratch using only **NumPy**. The notebooks include:

- **Mathematical Derivations**: The theoretical background for each model.
- **Model Implementations**: Code that implements each model without relying on any external ML libraries (other than NumPy).
- **Applications**: Example use cases and applications for each model.

## Models Implemented

The following models have been implemented in this repository:

### Supervised Learning

>#### Regression models
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
>#### Classification models
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**

### Unsupervised Learning
>#### Clustering
- **K-Means**
- **DBSCAN**
- **Fuzzy C-Means**

### Deep Learning
>#### Feed-forward networks
- **Simple Perceptron**
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
>#### Sequential models
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [Work in Progress]**

## To-Do List
- [ ] Refactor the LDA notebook for neater code and add headings
- [ ] Add description and headings to Simple Perceptron
- [ ] Add Support Vector Machine
- [ ] Add K-Nearest Neighbour
- [ ] Add CNN (Code is ready; need to port it to notebook format)
- [ ] Write the derivations for many of the notebooks

## Why This Repository?

This repository aims to provide a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of machine learning algorithms and how they work under the hood. By implementing these models from scratch, you gain insights into their inner workings, which is often abstracted away when using libraries like `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, or `PyTorch`.
